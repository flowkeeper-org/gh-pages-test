questions:
  - q: Why Another Pomodoro Timer?
    a: |
      Unlike other timers on the market, Flowkeeper is designed to be: a). Free Software; b). Support team synchronization scenarios. It is not just a Pomodoro timer, but a robust and open work tracking platform.
  - q: How is it better than XYZ?
    a: |
      Our unique killer feature is synchronizing Pomodoro cycles across teams of people. However, even if you use Flowkeeper alone, then most likely it: a). Supports other desktop OS better; b). Is more lightweight and performant; c). Is optimized for usability (keyboard shortcuts and advanced configuration); d). Is free as Freedom;
  - q: Is it really free?
    a: |
      Yes, it is totally free, and is distributed under the terms of GPL license, similar to Linux Kernel or Git.
  - q: Is my data safe? What about privacy?
    a: |
      We take user privacy seriously. Unless you synchronize your data via flowkeeper.org, Flowkeeper won't send any usage or other data anywhere. You might have noticed that this site doesn't have a Cookies banner -- it's because we don't use cookies for tracking you. When you use Offline mode, your data is stored in plaintext, unencrypted files on disk. You can see the filename in Settings and inspect its contents.
  - q: How can I report a bug or request a feature?
    a: |
      File an Issue on our GitHub page: https://github.com/flowkeeper-org/fk-desktop/issues.
  - q: How can I synchronize my Flowkeeper across several devices?
    a: |
      There are two options. First of all, you can synchronize data using Flowkeeper Server, which you can host yourself or rely on the one running at flowkeeper.org. Alternatively, you can use the default file-based data backend and synchronize the data file via the likes of Dropbox, OneDrive or rclone. And if you enable "Watch changes" option, you can synchronize Flokkeeper events across all your devices in near real-time.
  - q: Is there a mobile version?
    a: |
      At the moment there's no mobile version, but it can be created thanks to "Qt for Android" project. We will work on it once the desktop version is fully stable. AFAIK there's no PySide6 toolchain for iOS yet.
