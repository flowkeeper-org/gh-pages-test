questions:

  - q: Is it really free?
    a: |
      Yes, it is totally free, and is distributed under the terms of GPL license, similar to Linux Kernel or Git.
  - q: Is my data safe? What about privacy?
    a: |
      We take user privacy seriously. Unless you synchronize your data via flowkeeper.org, Flowkeeper won't send any usage or other data anywhere. You might have noticed that this site doesn't have a Cookies banner -- it's because we don't use cookies for tracking you. When you use Offline mode (the default behavior), your data is stored in a plaintext, unencrypted file on your disk. You can see the filename in Settings and inspect its contents. If you choose to synchronize
      your data with Flowkeeper.org, the application forces you to define a key, which is used to encrypt and decrypt data on your computer. Flowkeeper Server doesn't have that key, and thus cannot decrypt your data.
  - q: How can I report a bug or request a feature?
    a: |
      File an Issue on our GitHub page: https://github.com/flowkeeper-org/fk-desktop/issues.
  - q: How can I synchronize my Flowkeeper across several devices?
    a: |
      There are two options. First of all, you can synchronize data using Flowkeeper Server, which you can host yourself or rely on the one running at flowkeeper.org. Alternatively, you can use the default file-based data backend and synchronize the data file via the likes of Dropbox, OneDrive or rclone. And if you enable "Watch changes" option, you can synchronize Flokkeeper events across all your devices in near real-time. Flowkeeper.org requires end-to-end encryption, it won't allow Flowkeeper application store data in unencrypted form.
  - q: Is there a mobile version?
    a: |
      Check out https://app.flowkeeper.org and try to add it to your phone as a PWA. This app is still in its BETA stage, but you can use it to manage your backlogs and work items.
