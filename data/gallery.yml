      Flowkeeper can store its data in plaintext files, which you can copy, backup and edit yourself, if necessary.
      It can also monitor those files for changes, so that you can easily sync your work across computers if you store this file in OneDrive, Dropbox, etc.
      This is the default mode.

      Flowkeeper ticks and dings just like a real kitchen times. In addition to that, you can configure some melody to play while 
      you should be resting -- this quickly creates a strong reflex to take a pause.

  - title: "Web Interface"
    content: |
      Flowkeeper.org (this website) also provides a web UI (try app.flowkeeper.org), which allows accessing Flowkeeper 
      from your mobile phone, for example. This site is in its early BETA mode. Its functionality is severely limited,
      and its quality is nowhere near as good as the desktop client... yet.
